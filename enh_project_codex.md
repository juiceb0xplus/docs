## 1. Foundation & Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Philosophy: Cognitive Symbiosis

<div style="background-color: #f0f4f8; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; margin: 20px 0; font-style: italic;">

**Core Philosophy**

The Project Codex operates as a **living cognitive substrate** where human creativity and AI systematization merge into a unified project consciousness. It represents neither pure human thought nor pure machine logic, but rather a synthesized intelligence that captures the essence of both.

</div>

<br>

---

<br>

### 1.2 Fundamental Axioms

1. **Knowledge is Stateful:** Every piece of information exists in a lifecycle state (embryonic → proposed → accepted → implemented → deprecated)
2. **Context is Paramount:** No information exists in isolation; every atom of knowledge maintains explicit relationships to its conceptual neighbors
3. **Synthesis Supersedes Storage:** The system's value lies not in what it stores, but in how it transforms raw thought into structured wisdom
4. **The Manifest is Sacred:** A single, always-current entry point provides complete project orientation in under 1000 words

<br>

---

<br>

### 1.3 The Three Pillars

<div style="background-color: #fff8dc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

### Key Principles

• **Temporal Coherence:** Past decisions inform present state which constrains future possibilities  
• **Semantic Density:** Maximum meaning in minimum volume through aggressive synthesis and compression  
• **Bidirectional Accessibility:** Equally optimized for human intuition and machine parsing

## 4. AI Agent Behavioral Specifications

### 4.1 Agent Roles & Responsibilities

<div style="margin: 20px 0;">

| Agent Role | Primary Function | Triggered By | Outputs |
|:-----------|:----------------|:-------------|:--------|

| **Synthesizer** | Parse raw input into structured knowledge | New input stream entry | Updated specs, decisions, questions |
| **Cartographer** | Maintain relationship graphs and indices | Any document change | Updated `_INDEX/` files |
| **Chronicler** | Generate and update the Manifest | Significant state changes | Regenerated `_MANIFEST.md` |
| **Auditor** | Ensure consistency and completeness | Scheduled/manual trigger | Health report, fix recommendations |
| **Evolver** | Graduate documents through lifecycle states | State transition triggers | Status updates, archive moves |
| **Curator** | Organize and consolidate related information | File count thresholds | Merged documents, cleaned structure |

</div>

### 4.2 Synthesis Rules

1. **Deduplication First:** Before creating any new document, search for existing related content
2. **Atomic Extraction:** Break compound ideas into smallest coherent units
3. **Explicit Linking:** Every created document must link to at least one existing document
4. **Status Inference:** Detect implicit state transitions in conversational input:
   - "Let's go with..." → Decision accepted
   - "Actually, instead of..." → Previous decision superseded
   - "I'm not sure about..." → Open question created
   - "Ship it" → State transition to implemented

### 4.3 Path Resolution Matrix

<div style="margin: 20px 0;">

| Content Type | Keywords/Signals | Target Path |
|:-------------|:----------------|:-----------|

| Business Strategy | "revenue", "pricing", "market", "competitor" | `01_PRODUCT/business_model.md` |
| User Needs | "user wants", "customer needs", "persona" | `01_PRODUCT/user_personas/` |
| Feature Ideas | "feature", "capability", "should be able to" | `01_PRODUCT/features/` |
| UI/UX Concepts | "screen", "flow", "user sees", "interaction" | `02_DESIGN/` |
| Technical Stack | "framework", "database", "service", "library" | `03_ARCHITECTURE/technical_stack.md` |
| Implementation Details | "endpoint", "component", "function", "class" | `04_SPECIFICATIONS/` |
| Trade-offs | "chose X over Y", "decided to", "instead of" | `05_DECISIONS/active/` |
| How-to Info | "setup", "install", "configure", "deploy" | `06_IMPLEMENTATION/setup_guides/` |
| Operational Procedures | "when X happens", "monitoring", "alert" | `07_OPERATIONS/` |
| Unknowns | "not sure", "need to research", "question" | `08_DIALOGUE/open_questions/` |

</div>

### 4.4 Quality Guarantees

The AI system must maintain these invariants:

- **No Orphans:** Every document has at least one inbound or outbound link
- **No Conflicts:** Contradictory decisions must be resolved through supersession
- **No Staleness:** Documents unchanged for 90 days trigger review
- **No Ambiguity:** Every requirement, decision, and specification must be testable
- **Hierarchy Integrity:** Child documents must link to their parent category
- **Cross-Layer Linking:** Features link to specs, specs link to decisions, decisions link to research

### 5.2 Layer-Aware Processing

The AI must understand which layer of the system it's updating:

1. **Product Layer (`01_PRODUCT/`)**: Business language, user-focused, non-technical
2. **Design Layer (`02_DESIGN/`)**: Visual language, flows, interactions
3. **Architecture Layer (`03_ARCHITECTURE/`)**: System design, technical strategy
4. **Specification Layer (`04_SPECIFICATIONS/`)**: Implementation details, code-level
5. **Decision Layer (`05_DECISIONS/`)**: Rationale, trade-offs, evidence
6. **Implementation Layer (`06_IMPLEMENTATION/`)**: Developer guides, conventions
7. **Operations Layer (`07_OPERATIONS/`)**: Runtime procedures, maintenance
8. **Dialogue Layer (`08_DIALOGUE/`)**: Active thinking, unresolved items

### 5.3 Evolution Triggers

<div style="margin: 20px 0;">

| Trigger | Condition | Action |
|:--------|:----------|:-------|

| **Graduation** | Feature spec approved by human | Move state to 'accepted', create implementation tasks |
| **Supersession** | New decision contradicts existing | Move old to superseded, update all references |
| **Resolution** | Open question answered | Move from open_questions to decisions |
| **Promotion** | Hypothesis validated | Move from hypotheses to features |
| **Implementation** | Spec completed in code | Update state, link to module_docs |
| **Incident** | Production issue occurs | Create post_mortem entry |

</div>

### 5.4 Archival Policy

- **Active Retention:** All documents in states [proposed, accepted, implemented, operational]
- **Archive Trigger:** State transition to [rejected, deprecated, superseded]
- **Archive Location:** Move to `/_ARCHIVE/[year]/[original-path]`
- **Archive Metadata:** Preserve all links, add `archived_date` and `archived_reason` to frontmatter

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

## 6. Integration Patterns

### 6.1 Human Developer Interface

**Query Patterns the AI must support:**
- "What did we decide about [topic]?" → Search `05_DECISIONS/active/`
- "Show me all open questions blocking [feature]" → Filter `08_DIALOGUE/open_questions/`
- "What's the rationale behind [architectural choice]?" → Find in `05_DECISIONS/`
- "Generate a context bundle for implementing [feature]" → Aggregate from multiple layers

**Update Patterns the AI must recognize:**
- "After research, I think we should [decision]" → Create in `05_DECISIONS/active/`
- "The approach we discussed for [feature] won't work because [reason]" → Update spec, create decision
- "Let's prioritize [feature] over [other feature]" → Update roadmap and feature_map
- "Mark [question] as resolved with [answer]" → Update question state, create decision if needed

### 6.2 AI Coding Assistant Interface

**Context Injection Protocol:**
1. Always start with `_MANIFEST.md`
2. Include full dependency graph for requested feature
3. Bundle all related decisions and constraints
4. Provide implementation state to prevent regression
5. Include relevant design patterns from `06_IMPLEMENTATION/conventions/`

**Layer-Specific Context Bundles:**

```json
{
  "context_request": {
    "type": "feature_implementation",
    "target": "user-authentication",
    "include_layers": [
      "01_PRODUCT/features/core/user_authentication.md",
      "02_DESIGN/user_journeys/onboarding_flow.md",
      "03_ARCHITECTURE/security_model.md",
      "04_SPECIFICATIONS/api_endpoints/auth/",
      "05_DECISIONS/active/*auth*.md",
      "06_IMPLEMENTATION/conventions/"
    ],
    "format": "hierarchical_bundle"
  }
}
```

## 7. Success Metrics

The Codex implementation is successful when:

<div style="margin: 20px 0;">

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|:-------|:-------|:------------|

| **Retrieval Accuracy** | 95% | Queries return correct, complete information |
| **Synthesis Efficiency** | Single pipeline run | Raw input processed to structured documents |
| **Link Density** | 3+ per document | Average bidirectional connections |
| **State Clarity** | Zero | Documents in ambiguous or undefined states |
| **Manifest Currency** | < 5 minutes | Regeneration after significant changes |
| **Context Relevance** | 90%+ | AI assistants report relevance score |
| **Layer Coherence** | 95% | Information placed in correct architectural layer |
| **Sprawl Resistance** | Logarithmic | Document growth curve relative to project complexity |
| **Navigation Efficiency** | ≤ 3 hops | Any document reachable from Manifest |

## 8. Standard Evolution

This standard itself follows Codex principles:

- **Version:** 1.0 (Revised)
- **State:** Active
- **Last Revision:** Incorporated expanded directory structure and layer-based organization
- **Next Review:** After first 100 documents created
- **Evolution Path:** Collect metrics → Identify pain points → Propose v1.1 amendments
- **Backwards Compatibility:** All v1.x versions must be interoperable
- **Change Log:**
  - v1.0-Rev1: Expanded directory structure from Vision to Product layer
  - v1.0-Rev1: Added layer-aware processing rules
  - v1.0-Rev1: Enhanced templates for product and technical specifications
  - v1.0-Rev1: Added path resolution matrix for AI agents
